## Pamela Patterson's Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and projects I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. 

### Carbon Market trading - data cleaning - paid project
This project was contracted by Water Climate Trust. They were preparing for work at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Poland. The objective was to use the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project data available through the UN to uncover patterns and issues with the carbon market trading stystem. I did initial research and gathered the raw data, then I cleaned the data to make it easier to use. The next stage of the project, commencing in late Summer 2019, will be to generate graphics and perform a deeper analysis. 

Part 1 of the data cleaning can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Carbon-Market/blob/master/CDM-consolidated.ipynb)

### Insights Into Bike Sharing in the Bay Area
[This](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/SF_bike_share/blob/master/sf_bike_share_project141_to_generate_HTML.ipynb) was a group project for a graduate data science course taken at UC Davis. We obtained bike share usage data, including stations used, trip duration, and member status for 3 years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. We compared this data to weather data, neighborhood data (crime, income), and proximity of bike share stations to Caltrain stations. Our goal was to gain insights into the new bike share program in order to inform future expansion efforts.
