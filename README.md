# Pamela Patterson's Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and projects I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Carbon Market trading - data cleaning - paid project
This project was contracted by Water Climate Trust. They were preparing for work at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Poland. The objective was to use the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project data available through the UN to uncover patterns and issues with the carbon market trading stystem. I did initial research and gathered the raw data, then I cleaned the data to make it easier to use. The next stage of the project, commencing in late Summer 2019, will be to generate graphics and perform a deeper analysis. 

Part 1 of the data cleaning can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Carbon-Market/blob/master/CDM-consolidated.ipynb)

Part 2 of the data cleaning can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Carbon-Market/blob/master/CDM-projects.ipynb)

## Insights Into Bike Sharing in the Bay Area
[This](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/SF_bike_share/blob/master/sf_bike_share_project141_to_generate_HTML.ipynb) was a group project for a graduate data science course taken at UC Davis. We obtained bike share usage data, including stations used, trip duration, and member status for 3 years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. We compared this data to weather data, neighborhood data (crime, income), and proximity of bike share stations to Caltrain stations. Our goal was to gain insights into the new bike share program in order to inform future expansion efforts.

## Machine Learning Problems and Projects
These are problems, project, and assignments I worked on while in grad school. 

#### K-nearest neighbors, linear regression, and risk
See homework assignment with both conceptual and data analysis problems [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/HW1.ipynb). 

#### Linear and Logistic Regression, sklearn, Lasso
See homework assignment with both conceptual and data analysis problems [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/HW2.ipynb).

#### Ordinary Least Squares Fit, Loss functions, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
See homework assignment with both conceptual and data analysis problems [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/HW3.ipynb).

#### Cross validation and more SVMs
See homework assignment with both conceptual and data analysis problems [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/HW4.ipynb).

#### Random Forests and more SVMs
See homework assignment with both conceptual and data analysis problems [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/HW5.ipynb).

#### Project: Stock Market prices and the news
This project involved scraping websites for data and gathering multiple data sources. We then chose our method of analysis and assessed its effectiveness. See the project [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Project.ipynb) for more detail. Supporting notebooks are [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/sentiment_scoring.ipynb) and [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pamelot317/Machine_Learning/blob/master/webscraping.ipynb).
